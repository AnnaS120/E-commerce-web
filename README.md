# Margot Jewellery – Commercial Website

## Project Overview
## 📌 Project Overview
Margot Jewellery is a responsive commercial e-commerce website designed to showcase and sell jewellery products, including earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and rings. The project focuses on clean UI design, intuitive navigation, and strong visual presentation to reflect a modern fashion brand.

This website was built as a front-end development project to demonstrate practical skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as an understanding of user experience and commercial website structure. This project was designed and developed entirely from scratch by me, without the use of AI-assisted coding tools.
